            Using these algorithms, image data from multiple imaging modalities can be matched and
presented in a common coordinate system, therefore, anatomical and functional image
information can be visualized simultaneously. Hence, biomedical image registration
enables clinical professionals a complete insight into the patient data and can help to
improve medical diagnosis and patient treatment (Handels, 2003).<br>

            Applications of biomedical image registration include radiation therapy, interventional
radiology, diagnostic and clinical decision-making, image-guided surgery, procedure
planning, and simulation, dynamic structural and functional change measurement,
treatment, and disease progression monitoring, minimally invasive procedures, and the
correlations between the function and morphology of human body. Furthermore, image
registration is widely used in biomedical imaging, which includes methods developed for
automated image labeling and pathology detection in individuals and groups. Moreover,
registration algorithms can encode patterns of anatomic variability in large human
populations, and can be used to create disease-specific, population-based atlases
(Bankman, 2000).<br>

            Although biomedical image registration has been intensively investigated and enormous
advances in imaging techniques have been achieved, the ever-increasing growth of
imaging data and their applications in medical and clinical environments ensures the
existence of future challenges in more precise and efficient biomedical image registration.<br>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>
            Accurate and efficient biomedical image registration can lead to additional clinical
information not apparent in the isolated images and provide clinical professionals with
sufficient information for diagnostic and medical decision-making. For example, functional imaging such as PET cannot provide very high-resolution image data, but by the
registration of these functional images with anatomical images, for example, CT scanning,
physiological and functional regions can be located more precisely (Figure 2). After
automatic image registration to localize and identify anatomy and lesions, accurate
diagnostic and clinical decision-making can be achieved. Such functional-to-anatomical
data registration is very useful for clinical diagnosis and surgical operation, especially
for telesurgery. By presenting relevant clinical information to clinicians at the point of
care, biomedical image registration can improve the quality of care, patient safety, and
healthcare benefits<br>

            As a fundamental task in image processing, the process of registration aims to match two
data sets that may differ in time of acquisition, imaging sensors, or viewpoints. Because
of its crucial role in improving healthcare quality, medical image registration has been
studied extensively for decades, which has resulted in a bulk of reviews, surveys, and books, for example, Bankman (2000); Brown (1992); Fitzpatrick, Hill, and Maurer (2000);
Lester and Arridge (1999); Maintz and Viergever (1998); Mäkelä (2002); Maurer and
Fitzpatrick (1993); Rohr (2000); and van den Elsen, Pol, and Viergever (1993), . According
to the registration feature space, principally, medical image registration can be distinguished into intensity-based registration and feature-based registration (Brown, 1992).<br>
           </p>

     <div class="hi1">
            
            <p>
            As one principal medical image registration methodology, intensity-based registration
has attracted significant attention in the research community. As a result, numerous
registration approaches have been proposed and used, for example, correlation based
methods, Fourier-based approaches, the moment and principal axes methods [Alpert,
Bradshaw, Kennedy, and Correia,(1990)], minimizing variance of intensity ratios (Woods,
Mazziotta, and Cherry , 1993; Hill, Hawkes, Harrison, and Ruff, 1993), and mutual
information methods (Collignon, Vandermeulen, Suetens, and Marchal 1995; Viola and
Wells, 1995). Directly exploiting the image intensities, the intensity-based registration
algorithms have the advantages of no segmentation required and few user interactions
involved, and most importantly, these methods have potential to achieve fully automated
registration. However, this category of schemes does not make use of a priori knowledge
of the organ structure and the registration computation is not efficient. In order to
improve the registration performance, speed, accuracy, and at same time to avoid the local
minima, hierarchical medical image registration has been proposed, for example, Thevenaz
and Unser (2000), and Pluim, Mainze, and Viergever (2001).<br>
           </p>
        </div>
    <div class="hi1">
            
            <p>
            The other principal medical image registration category is based on corresponding
features that can be extracted manually or automatically. The feature-based medical
image registration methods can be classified into point-based approaches, for example,
Besl and MaKey (1992); Bookstein (1992); and Fitzpatrick, West, and Maurer (1998);
curve-based algorithms, for example, Maintz, van den Elsen, and Viergever (1996) and
Subsol (1999); and surface-based methods, for example, Audette, Ferrie and Peters (2000)
and Thompson and Toga (1996). One main advantage of feature-based registration is that
the transformation can be stated in analytic form, which leads to efficient computational
schemes. However, in the feature-based registration methodologies, a preprocessing
step of detecting the features is needed and the registration results are highly dependent
on the result of this preprocessing.<br>

            <p>
            In medical image registration, a transformation which maps datasets obtained from
different times, different viewpoints, and different sensors, must be determined. Depending on the characteristics of the differences between the medical images to be registered,
generally, the registration transformations can be divided into rigid and non-rigid
transformations. The rigid transformations can be used to cope with rotation and
translation differences between the images. But usually, patient postures, tissue structures, and the shapes of the organs cannot always remain the same when they are imaged
with different imaging devices or at different times, therefore, elastic or non-rigid
registrations are required to cope with these differences between the images (Rohr, 2000).
The elastic medical image registration was first introduced by Bajcsy (1989). As a
challenging and active research topic, elastic medical image registration has attracted
extensive attentions of researchers and a number of novel methods have been proposed;
for example, a block matching strategy was used by Lin et al. (1994), and a flexible fluid
model was proposed by Christensen, Kane, Marsh, and Vannier (1996). Elastic biomedical image registration is still an ongoing and challenging research topic and a lot of efforts
are needed in this area.<br>

            <h2>Technological Fundamentals of
Biomedical Image Registration</h2>
        <h4>Biomedical Image Registration Definition</h4>
            <p>
            The problem of registration arises whenever images acquired from different sensors, at
different times, or from different subjects need to be combined or compared for analysis
or visualization. Biomedical image registration is the primary tool for comparing two or
more medical images to discover the differences in the images or to combine information
from multimodality medical images to reveal knowledge not accessible from individual
images. Its main task is to determine a mapping to relate the pixels of one image to the
corresponding pixels of a second image with respect to both space and intensity.

            <h2>Biomedical Registration Transformations</h2>
        
            <p>
            Biomedical image distortions must be taken into consideration when two sets of medical
images are to be registered. There are many factors that can result in medical image
distortions, for example, different underlying physics of imaging sensors, inter-subject
differences, voluntary and involuntary movements of the subject during imaging. These
distortions impose many challenges for biomedical image registration because image
characteristics and distortions determine the registration transformations. For more
details on medical imaging deformation characteristics and registration transformations,
please refer to Bankman (2000); Fitzpatrick, Hill, and Maurer (2000); Turner and Ordidge
(2000). According to its transformation type, biomedical image registration can be
divided into rigid registration and non-rigid registration.
<br>
     </div>
    <div class="hi1">
            
            <p>
            The rigid registration is used to correct the simplest distortions caused by rotation and
translation. Because of the rigid structure of the skull, the distortions of the brain images
are often assumed as rigid distortions. When the brain image registration is carried out,
the rigid transformation, which preserves the lengths and angle measures, is often used
to correct these translation and rotation displacements.<br>
           </p>
        </div>
    <div class="hi1">
            
            <p>
            Affine transformation, which maps parallel lines into parallel lines, is used for the
correction of translation, rotation, scaling, and skewing of the coordinate space. For
example, affine transformation is useful for the correction of skewing distortion in CT
caused by tilted gantry.<br>
           </p>
        </div>
    <div class="hi1">
            
            <p>
            Non-rigid medical image deformations can be caused by the dramatic changes of the
subject positions, tissue structures, and the shapes of the organs when the subject is
imaged with different imaging devices or at different times. Usually, different imaging
devices require the subject to pose differently to get optimal imaging results, therefore,
rigid and affine transformations are not sufficient for correcting these non-rigid deformations. The involuntary motions of the lung and the heart lead to elastic deformations
which cannot be registered using rigid and affine transformations as well. Even brain
structure cannot always be considered as the same over time because of the differences
between pre-operation and post-operation. Non-rigid image registration is an active
research area, which is important for correcting the soft tissue deformations, temporal
displacements due to disease progression and surgical intervention, and individual
variations. In elastic transformations, the straightness of lines cannot be preserved and
the transformations can be arbitrarily complex.<br>
           </p>

    <div class="hi2">
            <h2>Implementation Issues</h2>
        
            <p>
            Interpolation is required when an image needs to undergo transformations. Usually, the
intra-slice resolution is higher than the inter-slice resolution, hence, the interpolation
operation should be carried out to compensate for this difference. Images from different
imaging modalities have different resolution, therefore in a multimodal image registration,
lower resolution images are often interpolated to the sample space of the higher
resolution images. Lehmann, Gönner, and Spitzer (1999) presented a survey of interpolation methods in medical image processing.
